# PASSWORD GENERATOR
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/t0B5QgyVLlQ>
#### Description: The password generator is a very simple program. It allows the user to create between 5 and 25 characters, and comes with some interactions that make it easy to use.

### I made a folder called: Generator and inside of this folder i created 3 files to begin:
> index.HTML
##
> style.css
##
> script.js

### And finally a folder for insert my logo:
> assets

#
## I chose this program PASSWORD GENERATOR becouse is basically a password generator using characters, from all letters of the alphabet including numbers, my project doesn't use characters like ! or something like that, because some sites still don't accept this type of password, so for me to know that I researched on some sites I registered as a user, and almost all sites ask for capital letters along with some number, only some sites asked for others characters like # or !.
#
## I made this website so that the user could have the facility to generate a quick and practical password, where in the HTML I made the whole structure so that the style.css and the script.js were linked.
#
## In stile.css I researched colors and which they are user-friendly for their use, to build trust so that the user understands that the link is real and that he can trust and click, I preferred to leave it aligned with the center of the page, because for those who use it on a smartphone, they will be able to have a better view and will not need to drag the screen to see the information.
#
## in script.js I did all the programming so that the link is generated with the new password and a button for the user to just click and copy automatically, thus making it easier for the user to actually copy the password that is being generated, because in the case of the user only copying on paper using pencil or pen, there are no errors, or even if the user passes the mouse pointer and drags to copy, the same does not make a mistake and a letter is missing.
#
## when I started to think about doing this project, I wanted to create a project that would make life easier for users, if we think of a company that needs to create random passwords for its employees, for a school that needs to create random passwords with the selection of how many characters you can classify the password hierarchy within a company, for example: base employee and the head of the section, or even the manager, to enter the system according to responsibility, or even information security. I also made it for those who have doubts about how make a password difficult for anyone to discover, research shows that password generator sites make passwords that someone will never discover or try to hack your account, as there are many diversifications to find the chosen password.

# This is my final CS50x project and I hope you understand the purpose and how it was done by me.
